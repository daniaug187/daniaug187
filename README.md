# 👋 Hi, I’m Danielle Augustine!

## Data Analytics Leader | Transforming Data into Meaningful Impact

🔍 **Data-Driven | Analytics-Focused | Impact-Oriented**

From early childhood research to national public health initiatives, I’ve spent over a decade on a mission: turn mountains of messy data into clear, actionable insights that help people thrive. My journey winds through mental health studies, policy-shaping analytics, and the art of building surveys that actually make sense (yes, even the branching logic parts!).

I’m in my element wrangling multi-million-record healthcare datasets, designing REDCap and Qualtrics surveys that run like clockwork, and building dashboards in Power BI and R that make the “aha!” moments jump off the screen. My technical toolkit? Power BI, R, SQL, Excel, SPSS, SAS, mPlus, NVivo, REDCap, Qualtrics, and more - plus a growing love for Python (I’m working on leveling up!) and a curiosity for the world of Generative AI.

Recently, I’ve been drawn to the crossroads of data, business, and finance - excited by the possibilities of using analytics to inform strategy, optimize processes, and drive meaningful results for organizations and communities.

When I’m not deep in data, I bring ideas to life in a different way: as a crochet artist, turning yarn into art and relaxation into creativity.
